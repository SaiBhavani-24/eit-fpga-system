# eit-fpga-system
- The system is built around a master–slave topology: a master FPGA provides global control, synchronization, and data aggregation, while multiple slave FPGA modules interface with analog frontends (Digital to Analog Converters (DAC), ADCs, multiplexers, and current sources) to stimulate and acquire electrode signals. Each slave supports 32 electrodes, and the design scales up to 256 electrodes by combining eight modules. A Web-based graphical user interface (GUI) running on the PC side enables flexible user interaction and parameter configuration, while minimizing processing loadon the FPGA.
- The objective of this project is to design and implement a modular, reconfigurable, and scalable FPGAbased data acquisition and processing system for Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), The architecture is built around a Zynq UltraScale+ ZCU104 Master FPGA and multiple Kria kr 260 Slave FPGAs. The system supports 256 electrodes, dynamic stimulation control via SPI-driven DACs and MUXes, runtime configuration through AXI-Lite interfaces and high-speed parallel acquisition through SPI-driven ADCs. Data is transmitted from Slave FPGA's to Master FPGA through Aurora protocol and then from Master FPGA to a host PC via Ethernet. In this system engineering of this entire architecture is performed.
